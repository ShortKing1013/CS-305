# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a finanical consulting firm that is all about helping customers take charge of their finances. They plan to do this by hiring Global Rain (me) to develop a system to modernize their current operations. They want to ensure that all private data from any customer accounts are safe and/or must be verified before accessed or any data transfered.

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I did real well with generating certificates. Coding securely is essential because it protects software, data, and systems from malicious attacks, vulnerabilities, and unintended failures. One of the main things it protects is sensitive data, it also helps with things like preventing financial loss, maintaining trust and reputation and ensuring regulatory compliance. Secure coding helps businesses avoid legal penalties and ensures compliance with industry standards. Cyber threats continuously evolve. Secure coding ensures that software is built to withstand emerging attacks, reducing exposure to new vulnerabilities.

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenaging part for me what the checksum verification, I had a tough time getting the verification to pop up in the browser. 

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Increasing layers of security typically involves implementing a defense-in-depth strategy, where multiple security controls work together to protect systems from threats. Depending on the system you are looking at will help me to figure out which techniques to choose. Using the Maven Dependancy reports can help point on some of those vulnerabilities and how to suppress them.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

For future assignments / tasks some resources and tools that might be useful include; the OWASP plug in, having the encryption library like openSSL, using Valnerability scanning & secure testing, code analysis and then using sound coding practices like input validation & sanitiazation. 

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them both documents I attached in this repo and anything that needs a generated certificate.


Thank you!
